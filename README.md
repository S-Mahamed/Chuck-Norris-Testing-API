# Chuck-Norris-Testing-API
API Testing Framework for Chuck Norris
***********************************************
API Mini Project
You have been asked to create a testing framework for a live API of your choice

You will need to submit the following:

A fully functional API that implements a DTO
An example test bed showing all the possible tests that can be performed
A well written README file explaining how a tester will use your framework
Make sure that you are able to test:

The response code
The headers for the GET request
The actual JSON payload you receive
You will also be presenting your framework to the rest of the group. Plan this as if we are a group of testers interested in purchasing your framework. This presentation will be 10-15 minutes in length

Presentation sections:

What API did you choose?
Demo of the framework running
What did you test? How did you decide what to test?
How is the frame work structured?
Your README file
You Github repositry will also be checked for commit history and branches used. Please do not delete any branches from your project
